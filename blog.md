Object detection is a technology related to computer vision and image processing for detecting various kinds of semantic objects: like cars, trees, person, and so on, from images or video frames. Their application can be found in self-driving cars, video surveillance, object tracking, image retrieval, medical imaging systems, etc. With the traditional image processing methods, researchers had a tough time devising and generalizing the algorithm for various use-cases and that too with reasonable accuracy.

## ECG to Identify Individuals
#### Using ECG signals to authenticate an individual by a siamese network.

ECG is the depiction of the electric signals that come from the expansion and contraction of heart muscles, indirectly the flow of blood inside the heart. It depends on the anatomy and physiology of the heart which can vary with age, gender and myriad of other factors. And the most fascinating part is that it doesnâ€™t change over time for an individual, not even when the heart beats increase or decrease.

## To be a Solutions Architect
#### A guide to the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam.

A solutions architect is responsible for designing a system architecture specific to an application. For example, when you create a public website, the architect would be responsible for its security, backend servers, database, and other important aspects like scalability, availability, and cost. Getting certified by AWS not only gives you the credential to boast about but, also makes you familiar with the AWS cloud architecture that you can leverage to design an architecture for your application efficiently (using the best practices).
