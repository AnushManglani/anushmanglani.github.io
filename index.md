## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="img/Icon.jpg" width="200px" />

B.Tech in Computer Engineer from Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India. I have been working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from past 3 years, having experience in projects involving Computer Vision, Agriculture, Nuclear Physics, Parallel Computing, Medical Imaging, Satellite Imagery, and Audio Signal Processing. Besides the academic activities, I am very passionate about Body Building and Fitness.

## Research Interest

Application of Deep Learning and Computer Vision in the domain of Medical Imaging, Nuclear Physics, and Signal Processing.

## Research

#### Predicting the dynamics of Tokamak discharge <br> (Department of Atomic Energy, India)  [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06230)
- The aim of the research was to anticipate the phenomenon of Disruption during Plasma confinement in Aditya Tokamak.
- We were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma current 12ms prior to the actual disruption (4ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- The model was developed in Tensorflow using LSTM, and was successfully tested, giving real time inferencing with an accuracy of 95%.
- Input features included the readings of various diagnostics like plasma current, mirnov oscillations, loop voltage, bolo meter readings and many other.

#### 3D Prostate Segmentation of MR Images using FCNN [[code]](https://github.com/amanbasu/3d-prostate-segmentation) [[pdf]](http://grand-challenge-public.s3.amazonaws.com/evaluation-supplementary/40/0eee0725-be00-436c-9680-f2a234d2b1f2/Prostate_Segmenta_YQxkwBU.pdf)
- Segmentation of prostate from MRI considering 3D volume.
- Our model outperformed the results of V-net architecture in PROMISE12 challenge.

#### AmSat: A holistic system to classify temporal satellite imagery
- Temporal images were taken from Sentinel 2 satellite and a labeled dataset for classification was prepared.
- A customized I3D Inception network (3DCNN) was trained with heavy data augmentation methods to compensate for a very small dataset.
- The model was trained on AWS EC2 instance giving a validation accuracy of 85%.

#### Analysis of crop health
- Detection of crop species and diseases using image data.
- Predicting severity of the disease using the above information along with other parameters like soil, weather, region etc.

#### Speech Emotion Recognition [[code]](https://github.com/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition)
- Prediction of human emotions from raw audio using IEMOCAP database.
- Bidirectional LSTM was used along with local attention mechanism to focus on the part of speech which influence the emotion more.
- The architecture was trained on NVIDIA K80 system and gave results comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

#### Autonomous Car [[code]](https://github.com/amanbasu/Autonomous-Car-Prototype)
- A self-driving RC car which maneuvered itself on an indoor, hand-made track.
- Convolutional Neural Network was used to classify the direction of car from dashcam images.
- The model was able to achieve a classifying accuracy of 94%.

## Other Projects

#### Breaking Bill [[code]](https://github.com/amanbasu/Breaking-Bill)
- Android application to add expenses to a list along with the members who share it.
- Users can generate bills and split monthly expenses among members according to their contributions.

#### File Sender Application [[code]](https://github.com/amanbasu/Wifi-P2p)
- An android application to send files from one android device to another.
- The application used wifi direct and socket programming.
- It was capable to sharing any type of file format like image, audio, video, text, pdf, doc, xls etc.

#### Hospital Management System [[code]](https://github.com/amanbasu/hospital-management-system)
- A software developed on JavaFx to store hospital details like patient information, staff information, department details etc. in SQL database.
